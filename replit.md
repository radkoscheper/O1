## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS for styling with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation resolvers

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM modules)
- **Database**: Configured for PostgreSQL with Neon Database serverless
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for database operations
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL session storage with connect-pg-simple

### Development Setup
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared code between client and server
- **Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Error Handling**: Runtime error overlay for development
- **Build Process**: Separate build steps for client (Vite) and server (esbuild)

```

### CMS System
- **Content Storage**: JSON files in `content/` directory
- **CLI Interface**: `cms/cli.js` for content management
- **Auto-generation**: TypeScript data files created from JSON
- **Commands**: `new:destination`, `new:guide`, `list`, `generate`, `build`

### Data Models
- **Users**: Multi-role user management with permission controls (admin/editor/viewer)
- **Destinations**: Travel destinations with soft delete support and ranking system
- **Guides**: Travel guides with soft delete support and ranking system
- **Schema**: Defined using Drizzle ORM with Zod validation schemas
- **Backup System**: Soft delete with is_deleted and deleted_at columns for content recovery

### UI Components
- Modern, accessible component library based on Radix UI primitives
- Consistent design system with CSS variables for theming
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Dutch language interface for Polish travel content

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix
2. **Query Management**: TanStack Query handles caching, synchronization, and error states
3. **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for client-side validation
4. **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with toast notifications

### Database Operations
1. **Storage Interface**: Abstract storage layer with in-memory implementation for development
2. **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations with PostgreSQL dialect
3. **Migrations**: Database schema versioning through Drizzle Kit

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **Connection**: Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` required

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Primitive components for accessibility
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Lucide React**: Icon library

### Development Tools
- **Replit Integration**: Development environment with cartographer plugin
- **ESBuild**: Fast JavaScript bundler for server code
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the entire application

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Client Build**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
2. **Server Build**: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
3. **Static Assets**: Client build output served as static files

### Production Configuration
- **Environment**: `NODE_ENV=production`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via `DATABASE_URL`
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built client files
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for scalability

### Development vs Production
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR, in-memory storage
- **Production**: Static file serving, database-backed storage
- **Database**: Same PostgreSQL setup for both environments

The application follows a clean architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns, shared validation schemas, and a robust development environment setup for rapid iteration.
